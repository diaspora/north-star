## How do I find content by topic?

Hashtags are a way to categorize a post, usually by topic. Searching for a tag shows all posts, both public and private, with that tag that you have permission to see. This lets people who are interested in a given topic find public posts about it. Hashtags in comments will appear as a link to that tag's page, but it will not make that post (or comment) appear on that tag page. This only works for tags in posts.

If you search for a tag, you can sometimes see a list of people on the left-hand side of the tag page. These are the people who have listed that tag to describe themselves in their public profile. You can read more about your profile at "[How does diaspora* give me control over publishing my data?][control_over_publishing_data]"

After searching for a tag you can click the button at the top of the tag’s page to "follow" that tag. It will then appear in your list of followed tags in the left-hand menu. Clicking one of your followed tags takes you to that tag’s page so you can see recent posts containing that tag. Click on *#Followed Tags* in the left-hand column on your Stream page to see a stream of posts that include any one of your followed tags. Posts containing that tag will also be included in your main stream.

## What are the different streams and how do I use them?

There are several different *Streams* that you can choose for filtering the kind of content that you want to see. To help diaspora\* pods perform faster, your streams won’t be constantly reloaded automatically. Just refresh the page whenever you want to check for updates. You can access all kinds of different streams through the links in the left side-bar.

### What is my "Stream"?

Right after signing up and entering your basic profile information, you get to the main *Stream* for the first time. The stream is where you can find all new kinds of posts. To access your stream, or click the logo of your pod in the header bar, or click "Stream" in the left side-bar. Below you can find several filtering options for your stream.

Your main *Stream* is made up of three types of posts:

* Posts by people you are sharing with, which come in two types: public posts and limited posts shared with an aspect that you are part of. To remove these posts from your stream, simply stop sharing with the person.
* Public posts containing (at least) one of the tags that you follow. To remove these, stop following that tag.
* Public posts by people listed in the community spotlight. These can be removed by unchecking the "Show community spotlight in stream?" option in the *Account* tab of your *Settings*. You can read more about all your settings at "[How do I manage my account and data?][manage_account_and_data]"

All of the posts shown in the main *Stream* are sorted chronologically, with the newest post at the top.

### Can I restrict the posts in my stream to just those that I interacted with?

Yes. This stream is your *Activity Stream*. Click "My activity" in the left side-bar to display all posts that you interacted with in some way. If you want, you can filter this stream by the type of your interaction: As soon as you click "My activity" it will show "Liked posts" and "Commented posts" below. You can choose which posts to show in your *Activity Stream* by clicking on these categories. You can read more about post interactions at "[How do I interact with posts?][interact_with_posts]"

The *Activity stream* and its filtered versions are the only streams that aren't sorted chronologically. Instead, the posts in this stream are sorted by their latest interaction.

### Can I restrict the posts in my stream to just those that I was mentioned in?

Yes. To show only those posts that other people thought to be especially relevant for you so they mentioned you in their posts, click "@Mentions" in the left-hand column on your main Stream page. Here you can find all posts in which you've been mentioned. You can read more about interactions with people at "[How do I interact with people?][interact_with_people]"
The posts shown in your *@Mentions Stream* are sorted chronologically, with the newest post at the top.

### Can I restrict the posts in my stream to just those from certain aspects?

Yes. This stream is usually called the *Aspects Stream*. Click "My aspects" in the left side-bar and then click individual aspects in the list to select or deselect them. Only the posts by people in the selected aspects will appear in your stream. You can limit the selection of aspects to be displayed to as few or many as your aspects as you want. Once you've selected a set of aspects, these will be saved for this session and device. You can read more about aspects at "[What are aspects and how do I use them?][aspects]"
The posts shown in your *Aspects Stream* are sorted chronologically, with the newest post at the top.

### Can I restrict the posts in my stream to just those with a certain tag?

Yes. This stream is usually called the *Tags Stream*. Click "#Followed tags" in the left side-bar and your entire list of followed tags will expand. In your tags stream, you will see all public posts that contain at least one of your followed tags. To only display the stream for one tag, click that tag in the side-bar or in a post. You can find more about tags below in the section "How do hashtags work?".
The posts shown in your *#Followed tags Stream* are sorted chronologically, with the newest post at the top.

### Can I see all posts that are available on my pod?

Yes, this is called the *Public Stream*. Click "Public activity" in the left side-bar to display all public posts that your pod knows about. Public streams may look different on different pods, some containing different, more, or less posts than those on other pods. This is due to diaspora\*'s decentralized nature. Each pod only knows about those posts, that have been sent to this pod. This means the public stream of your pod contains public posts from all local users, their contacts, and posts that have been reshared by their contacts.
The posts shown in the *Public activity Stream* are sorted chronologically, with the newest post at the top.

## How can I navigate through my stream by using keyboard shortcuts?

In the stream view you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

* `j` – Jump to the next post
* `k` – Jump to the previous post
* `c` – Comment on the current post
* `l` – Like the current post
* `r` – Reshare the current post
* `m` – Expand the current post
* `o` – Open the first link in the current post
* `Ctrl+Enter` – Send the message you are writing

These keyboard shortcuts work with all streams, and also on profile pages. They can help you navigate through your stream a lot faster!
